# Overview
This repo contains the code for a Twitter bot that periodically posts images
generated by DALL·E. The theme is "Bible or anime", and the idea is to guess
whether the image prompt is a quote from the Bible or from an anime.

# Details
The first step was to get some quotes. All the code here is under the `/data`
directory. I grabbed a collection of Bible files from [jihongeek/BibleRecommendation](https://github.com/jihongeek/BibleRecommendation/commit/18666e86192c6f45c0218b714a2ed1d268548c3e)
and anime quotes from three different websites:
- https://fictionhorizon.com/best-anime-quotes/
- https://www.scarymommy.com/anime-quotes
- https://www.buzzfeed.com/joshcorrea/best-anime-quotes

To keep things simpler, instead of choosing a quote on the fly, I pre-populated
a CSV file with 200 Bible quotes and 200 anime quotes. This file is generated
by `/data/initialize_twitter_post_log.py` and is named `data/twitter_post_log.csv`.

Next, I needed to actually call out to DALL·E to create the image. I grabbed 
[ezzcodeezzlife/dalle2-in-python](https://github.com/ezzcodeezzlife/dalle2-in-python)
and heavily modified it for my purposes. Specifically, I was interested in 
stitching together multiple images to create big murals. DALL·E supports
"inpainting" -- submitting an image with a transparent portion and asking
DALL·E to fill it in. "Inpainting" can be used to extend the borders of existing
images. This required a bunch of images manipulation (see `pillow_utils.py`)
and I succeeded in widening an image from the original 1024 x 1024 to
2048 x 1024. I was planning to go even bigger and use up the entire 50 credits
per rolling 24 hours that users were granted during the preview phase, but on
July 20, 2022, the preview phase ended and the new free quota (with several 
one-off bonuses) was lowered to 15 credits per month! For now, I left the stubs
in place and might revisit this after DALL·E exits beta.
